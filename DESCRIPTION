Description: Utility functions for working with datasets gathered using
    OpenDataKit (ODK). These includes an API to interface with ODK Briefcase,
    a Java application for fetching and pushing ODK forms and their contents,
    that allows pulling of data from either a remote ODK Aggregate Server or a
    local ODK folder, a rename function to give more human readable variable
    names for ODK datasets, a merge function to create a single dataframe from a
    nested ODK dataset and an expand function to disaggregate multiple choice
    answers that have been collapsed into single code by ODK.
